# Simple Task Tracker

This is my first React.js pet-project. It includes the JSON-server for the mock backend.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies with `npm install`, run the JSON-server via `npm run server` (port 3030), and then run `npm start` to open the app in the browser. `npm run build` creates a build for production.

## Built With

- React.js;
- SCSS;
- JSON-server.
